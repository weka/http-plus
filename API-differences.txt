This is *mostly* drop-in compatible with httplib.HTTPConnection. That
was maintained in as many places as seemed sensible. Sadly, some areas
it didn't make much sense for varying reasons. The (known) deviations
are:

1) HTTPSConnection doesn't exist - use HTTPConnection(...,
use_ssl=True) instead. use_ssl is implied if connecting on port 443,
(but can be disabled with an explicit use_ssl=False), and use_ssl
implies port 443 if no port is specified.

2) Proxies are specified to the HTTPConnection constructor as a
separate host-port pair, rather than specifying the proxy host-port
pair as the server in the constructor. As such, request() only takes
absolute paths rather than full URIs.
